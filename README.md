## Background and Motivation

I am an engineer for my company's showroom. I need an AI agent framework that also supports IoT.

Test if Node-RED can be used as an AI agent framework

## Set up

### API Server

This project uses my original API server: https://github.com/araobp/compact-rag

### Node-RED

...

### Installing the package

It is useful to define a bash alias for installing the package in Node-RED.
```
alias rl='cd ~/.node-red;npm install ~/node-red-ai-agents/cx'
```
